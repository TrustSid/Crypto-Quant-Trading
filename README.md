# Crypto-Quant-Trading
A real-time crypto trading bot based on lagged correlation between ETH and LUMIA. The bot detects 1-hour ETH price surges, and schedules a LUMIA trade 3 hours later based on a predefined lag strategy. It supports live execution, fee-adjusted PnL tracking, Telegram alerts, and persistent state logging for continuous forward testing.
